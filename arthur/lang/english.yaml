# This is the YAML file used when playing point-and-click-arthur in English.
# This file:
# - does NOT contain game logic
# - can be tested with test_yaml.py
#
# This file is divided into three sections, PLACES, ITEMS, and MISC.
# ITEMS and MISC are very direct, their members consisting of an ID and
# the corresponding text. PLACES includes a number of IDs (the different
# locations in the game), which in turn contain ACTIONS that the player can
# do. These actions generate DIALOGs. Multiple DIALOGs in an action are split
# as such to divide between mid-conversation animations and the like, and are
# commented appropriately. DIALOGs consist of ACTOR(s) and an list of their
# dialog.
#
# Messages which are spoken by no-one are given an ACTOR of "Hail!".
