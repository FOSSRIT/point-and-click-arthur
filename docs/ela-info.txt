ELA Info
========
Information on 4th grade English ability based on New York State cirriculum.

Curriculum
----------
NYS 4th graders are learning about English composition, English language analysis, geometry, the age of colonization (Native Americans, explorers, Loyalists, Patriots), electricity, magnetism, and other things.

Vocabulary
----------
It appears that 4th graders generally understand "lengthy" words. Because of this, the concern should be if the topic was learned yet. The actual reading and pronunciation shouldn't be a problem.

A basic idea of 4th grade vocabulary can be found here: http://www.studyzone.org/testprep/ela4/o/vocabulary4l.cfm.

Reading Comprehension
---------------------
The NYS 4th grader ELA curriculum is largely focused on reading comphrension. Aruthur might want to focus on ideas like comparing, contrasting, linear thinking, story comprehension, and solving problems based on read information. The player might be asked to reflect on a previous event in the story, or make a decision based on a chain of previous events. Additionally, "what happened when", "why did this happen", and "this happened, what do you think" sort of questions are encouraged.

Regents
-------
NYS's infamous regents board might be able to lend us some help: Grade 4 ELA test booklets for previous years are available here: http://www.nysedregents.org/Grade4/EnglishLanguageArts/home.html. Much of this document was written based on the 2010 ELA Grade 4 testing booklets.
