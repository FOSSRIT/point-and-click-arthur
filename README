Point and Click King Arthur

This project will be a children's "point and click" adventure based on the King Arthur legend. 
The story follows King Arthur as he tries to collect all of his Knights of the Roundtable from their various quests and adventures. The player will play the role as King Arthur's royal investigator and will help the king along the way. 
The game will be heavy in graphics which will add to the atmosphere and story. The game's primary coding language will be Python, using the PyGame library to aid in graphics management. The game's target audience and device is the OLPC and children.

Getting users to read/reading comprehension

Story: 
Player is Arthur's Royal Detective, retrieve all the knights who are in the middle of their most famous quests for a banquent at Camalot
- Fit the stories to be age appropriate

Tech:
Look for existing point and click engines for pygame or other languages and adapt to our needs

Sound:

Art:
Do art ourselves or find an artist to help (ASAP, need artist!)

Resources:
Link to New York State Curriculum for grades K-12

To Do:
- Research when and how medieval history and literature is taught in Fourth Grade
- Find sound effects (must be public domain or free use!)
- Find an artist to help us or figure out a way to create art assets and animations
- Find a point and click engine for PyGame, or, a similar engine for another language that can be adapted to Python
